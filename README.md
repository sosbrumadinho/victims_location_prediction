# Victims Location Prediction

This project aims to implement a software library to predict victims
location after dam rupture or similar disasters.

## First use case (Brumadinho)
The most recent disaster is the [Brumadinho dam
rupture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brumadinho_dam_disaster) occurred
on 25 January 2019. At the moment this document is being written 99
people have been confirmed dead and 259 keep missed.


## How to collaborate
At the moment we need to elaborate some first version of algorithm able
to predict the data we're looking for. There are some questions we need
to answer, but these questions can change according to each method that
can be used. That way, feel free to isolate your work in a new directory
in this repository, document it properly and send the Pull Request
explaining your purpose, what you have discovered, how others can
contribute with you and how we can use what you are submitting.

## Current stage

At the moment part of the code has been developed in MATLAB. All the files can be found under the [matlab_code](./matlab_code) folder and it is being translated to Python. Check the [README](./test/README.md) file in the test folder for more details.
